            build <b>"Jump into the mind"</b> in a two Day Hackaton with SOMOS
            in collaboration of Activition and Blizzard. There will be obstacles
            in the way to be careful! This game takes place inside someone's
            mind and the chest symbolizes the goals and aspirations we all have.
            While we make an attempt to achieve these goals, there are
            situations we do not expect. Along the wya, there are also tools we
            can use to help us on our journey. We created the different
            "power-up" effects. (The orange, cake, and chocolate bar) Our
            teammate George also created other power ups that we did not have
            time to implement. These were: a donut, a taco, and kebab. We did
            not create music for this game. We wanted to create our own sound
            track for the gameplay, but we were not able to finish anything
            complete on time.

          <h3>League of Legends</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a League of Legends fan page to both celebrate one of my
            favorite games and to demonstrate my proficiency in SCSS, HTML, and
            JavaScript. This project exemplifies my capability to design
            responsive websites, integrating my passion for gaming with my web
            development skills. The site serves as a vibrant showcase of my
            technical abilities, offering a dynamic user experience that adapts
            seamlessly across devices.

          <h3>BeachFinder-AppPreview 🐠🐟🎏</h3>
          <p>
            I designed the "BeachFinder-App🐠🐟🎏" website as a prototype user
            interface for a hypothetical social media platform. This project
            highlights my skills in UI/UX design, offering a glimpse into how I
            can craft intuitive and modern interfaces for web applications.
            While currently serving as a showcase of my design capabilities,
            this template lays the groundwork for future development and
            enhancement. It represents a step towards realizing a fully
            functional social media app, demonstrating my commitment to creating
            seamless user experiences.<a

            The "Guardians of the Hatchlings" website showcases a UI/UX design
            for interfacing with my machine learning model hosted on AWS Lambda,
            developed using Amazon SageMaker and S3 for model training and data
            storage, respectively. This front-end was designed to manage POST
            requests where users could upload images, and the API would identify
            whether the subject was a turtle. Although the cloud-based API has
            since been decommissioned due to budget constraints, the
